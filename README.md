# Graphics Programming Discord - Moderation Actions

This repository serves as a board to track major moderation actions for the Graphics Programming discord server (https://discord.gg/6mgNGk7).  In addition, this is the forum to contest bans from the server.  In order to contest a ban, please open an issue.

## Discord Server Rules

1. Be nice and respectful.
2. When you ask a question:
   - Don't ask if you can ask, just ask (in the appropriate channel)
   - Debug the issue yourself first to the best of your ability, using renderdoc if possible: https://renderdoc.org/docs/getting_started/quick_start.html
   - Explain your issue in detail. “it doesn’t work” is not a sufficient problem description
   - Explain what you've tried already
   - Support your question with code/screenshots/renderdoc captures if possible
   - Simplify code to only what’s relevant to your question, don't post screenshots of code, remember you can format code on discord
   - Be patient and don't crosspost if you don't get an immediate response
   - Don’t ask for help with LLM output (e.g. ChatGPT)
3. Don't ask us to do your homework for you.
4. Don't send links using URL shorteners.
5. Any form of advertising must be cleared with moderators first. This includes invites to other discord servers.
6. Do **not** discuss or distribute illegal content (even if leaked by a third party), hacking or cheating technologies, or post gory or otherwise disturbing imagery.
7. Keep discussions on-topic
8. No discussion of politics, religion, etc. in any channels

## Infractions

Disruptive behavior will result in warnings or bans:
- Warning (lasts 3 days)

3 strike rule: warnings count as 1 strike, strikes last 3 months, 3 active strikes result in a permaban.
